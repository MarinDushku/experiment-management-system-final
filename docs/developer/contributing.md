### 3. Make Changes

#### Code Style Guidelines

**JavaScript/Node.js (Backend)**
- Use ES6+ features consistently
- Follow existing code formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Handle errors appropriately

```javascript
/**
 * Creates a new experiment with validation
 * @param {Object} experimentData - Experiment configuration
 * @param {string} experimentData.name - Experiment name
 * @param {string} experimentData.description - Experiment description
 * @param {string} userId - ID of the creating user
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Created experiment object
 * @throws {ValidationError} When validation fails
 */
async function createExperiment(experimentData, userId) {
  try {
    // Implementation here
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
}
```

**React/JavaScript (Frontend)**
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use descriptive component names
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript types

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const ExperimentCard = ({ experiment, onSelect }) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effects here
  }, [experiment.id]);

  return (
    <div className="experiment-card">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

ExperimentCard.propTypes = {
  experiment: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
  onSelect: PropTypes.func.isRequired
};
```

**Python (OpenBCI Integration)**
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Handle exceptions properly

```python
def collect_eeg_data(participant_name: str, duration: int = 60) -> str:
    """
    Collect EEG data from OpenBCI device.
    
    Args:
        participant_name: Name of the participant
        duration: Recording duration in seconds
        
    Returns:
        Filename of the saved EEG data
        
    Raises:
        OpenBCIConnectionError: When device is not connected
        ValidationError: When parameters are invalid
    """
    try:
        # Implementation here
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        # Error handling
        raise
```

#### Testing Requirements

**All contributions must include appropriate tests:**

**Backend Tests**
```javascript
// Unit test example
describe('ExperimentController', () => {
  describe('createExperiment', () => {
    it('should create experiment with valid data', async () => {
      const experimentData = {
        name: 'Test Experiment',
        description: 'Test description'
      };
      
      const result = await request(app)
        .post('/api/experiments')
        .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)
        .send(experimentData)
        .expect(201);
        
      expect(result.body.name).toBe(experimentData.name);
    });

    it('should reject experiment with invalid data', async () => {
      const invalidData = { name: '' };
      
      await request(app)
        .post('/api/experiments')
        .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)
        .send(invalidData)
        .expect(400);
    });
  });
});
```

**Frontend Tests**
```javascript
// Component test example
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import ExperimentCard from '../ExperimentCard';

describe('ExperimentCard', () => {
  const mockExperiment = {
    id: '1',
    name: 'Test Experiment',
    description: 'Test description'
  };

  it('renders experiment information correctly', () => {
    render(<ExperimentCard experiment={mockExperiment} onSelect={jest.fn()} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Experiment')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('Test description')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('calls onSelect when clicked', () => {
    const mockOnSelect = jest.fn();
    render(<ExperimentCard experiment={mockExperiment} onSelect={mockOnSelect} />);
    
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Test Experiment'));
    expect(mockOnSelect).toHaveBeenCalledWith(mockExperiment);
  });
});
```
